        h1 Chan the Bird Man’s Graduate Bird Flyer Program
        p I strive to improve Parrots lives through exercise and proper nutrition, and I am proud of showcasing their abilities to fly freely and come back with prefect recall.

          |I’d like to support the lives of your birds by providing education services that will help you to nurture your flock. Most importantly, my goal as a behaviorist is to educate the members of your community about birds so we can co-exist peacefully and have them accompany you in your lifestyle and not be caged birds. Chan Quach’s Graduate Bird Flyer program is available to you and your free-flight clubs. Other services include: veterinarian visits, lifestyle flying adjustments (country, suburb, busy downtown living and flying), so you can be active with your birds while jogging or bicycling, etc. In graduating the Graduate Bird and Flyer program, your challenges with aggression, screaming, harness, and seasonal hormones will be addressed. My preference is effective home visits in Los Angeles. I travel as well as offering Skype and FaceTime sessions.
